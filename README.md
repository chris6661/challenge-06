# Weather Dashboard Using API
## This site was designed using API to show you the temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV Index, and 5 day forecast of a given city the user types in. If an 'empty' answer is given, the page will ask for a city name. It will also hold the cities the user searches for in local storage so that they can be easily reviewed again to compare to the most recent search. The UV index is color coded with green for a UV index of 0-2, yellow for a UV index of 2-5, red for a UV index of 5-10, and blue for a UV index of greather than 10.
